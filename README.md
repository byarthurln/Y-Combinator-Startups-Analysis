## Project Context

This project aims to analyze the startups incubated by Y Combinator to identify trends, investment opportunities, and actionable insights. The dataset used for this analysis includes information about startups such as company name, description, location, founding year, number of founders, and more.

### Why This Project?

This project is driven by my curiosity and the questions I have about the startups in Y Combinator. I wanted to understand the factors that contribute to the success of these startups and gain insights that could help me in my own entrepreneurial journey. By analyzing this data, I aim to answer questions that I believe are crucial for anyone interested in the startup ecosystem.

## How the Analysis is Conducted

### Data Collection

The initial dataset is a CSV file containing information about Y Combinator startups. 

### Analysis and Visualization

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed using Python (Pandas).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - EDA is conducted to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.
   - Tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

3. **Visualization**
   - Interactive dashboards and visualizations are created using Power BI to present the findings.

### Questions to Answer

1. **Geographical Analysis**
   - Which countries and cities are most represented among Y Combinator startups?
   - Are there specific geographical trends that could influence investment decisions?
