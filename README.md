## Project Context

This project aims to analyze the startups incubated by Y Combinator to identify trends, investment opportunities, and actionable insights. The goal is to help a venture capital firm make informed decisions about which startups to invest in. The dataset used for this analysis includes information about startups such as company name, description, location, founding year, number of founders, and more.

### *️⃣ Why This Project?

As an aspiring entrepreneur, I have followed all the YouTube videos of Y Combinator and have been closely tracking the startups that are incubated there. My dream is to one day join this prestigious incubator. This project is driven by my curiosity and the questions I have about the startups in Y Combinator. I wanted to understand the factors that contribute to the success of these startups and gain insights that could help me in my own entrepreneurial journey. By analyzing this data, I aim to answer questions that I believe are crucial for anyone interested in the startup ecosystem.

### *️⃣ Questions to Answer

   - What proportion of startups have a website, Crunchbase page, or LinkedIn page?
   - Is there a correlation between online presence and the success of the startup?

8. **Batch Analysis**
   - How are startups distributed across different Y Combinator batches?
   - Are there particularly high-performing or low-performing batches?

## How the Analysis is Conducted

### *️⃣ Data Collection

The initial dataset is a CSV file containing information about Y Combinator startups. To enrich this dataset, additional data is collected using APIs and web scraping.

### *️⃣ Enriching the Dataset

1. **Founders' Information**
   - Names, education, and professional experiences of the founders are collected using LinkedIn, Crunchbase, or the startups' websites.
   - Tools: LinkedIn API, Crunchbase API, BeautifulSoup for web scraping.

2. **Funding Rounds**
   - Information about funding rounds is collected using Crunchbase or AngelList APIs.
   - Tools: Crunchbase API, AngelList API.

### *️⃣ Data Integration

The collected data is integrated into the existing CSV file using Python. The enriched dataset is then used for analysis.

### *️⃣ Analysis and Visualization

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed using Python (Pandas).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - EDA is conducted to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.
   - Tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

3. **Visualization**
   - Interactive dashboards and visualizations are created using Power BI to present the findings.
